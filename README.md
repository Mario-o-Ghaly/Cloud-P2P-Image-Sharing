## Description
This project aims to implement a cloud-based peer-to-peer(P2P) environment for image encryption and sharing, emphasizing transparency, load balancing, fault tolerance, and P2P communication. The cloud simply consists of 3 interconnected servers communicating with each other P2P to support leader election, load balancing, and fault tolerance in handling client requests. Moreover, the cloud is associated with a user-oriented discovery service to keep track of active users and the images they offer for sharing. On the other hand, the client side's high-level objective is simply to control image exchange with other clients through ownership and viewer rights. The following sections will extensively explain the requirements of each component in the project to provide a detailed understanding of the project at hand.
